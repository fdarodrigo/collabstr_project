# collabstr_project

This project is part of a technical challenge for Collabstr, designed to display influencer information from a database on a web page. The displayed data includes photos or videos of influencers, their prices, and the platform they operate on. Users can filter influencers by platform to find relevant content.

Objective
The goal of this project is to demonstrate web development skills with a focus on readable, scalable, and maintainable code. I aimed to adhere to best practices in Python coding as per PEP 8 guidelines. Due to the project's small size, I opted for simple JavaScript solutions, such as using setTimeout, despite it not being the most elegant solution, due to time constraints.

Key Features
- Display influencers with photos or videos, prices, and platforms.
- Filtering influencers by platform.
- Downloading content using a CORS-bypassing solution.
